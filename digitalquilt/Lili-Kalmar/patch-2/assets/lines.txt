I don't love you, I don't need you
I don't ever want to see you again
'Cause girl, I moved on and things are perfect
I'm okay with us just being friend
'Cause I don't think about you every
Single night; I'll be fine without you
Can sleep tight when I'm not beside you; I'm moving on
No, I don't cry about you; never seen tears in my eyes about you
Gonna be fine if I die without you; baby, I'm gone
These are the lies that I tell myself at night
These are the lies that are keeping me alive
These are the lies
(La-la-la-la-lies. La-la-la-la-lies. La-la-la-la-lies lies.)
These are the lies
(La-la-la-la-lies. La-la-la-la-lies. La-la-la-la-lies lies.)
I've got a new girl and she's my whole world
And I don't care if you're not sleeping alone
'Cause life is so good; I'm doing so good
Don't spend hours sitting here by the phone
'Cause I don't think about you every
Single night; I'll be fine without you
Can sleep tight when I'm not beside you; I'm moving on
No, I don't cry about you; never seen tears in my eyes about you
Gonna be fine if I die without you; baby, I'm gone
These are the lies that I tell myself at night
These are the lies that are keeping me alive
These are the lies
(La-la-la-la-lies. La-la-la-la-lies. La-la-la-la-lies lies.)
These are the lies
(La-la-la-la-lies. La-la-la-la-lies. La-la-la-la-lies lies.)
These are the lies. These are the lies
These are the lies. These are the lies
These are the lies. These are the lies
These are the lies. These are the lies
These are the lies. These are the lies
'Cause the truth is, I'm about to lose it
Don't think I can do this if I'm not with you
'Cause the truth is, I'm about to lose it
Don't think I can do this if I'm not with you
'Cause the truth is, I'm about to lose it
Don't think I can do this if I'm not with you
'Cause the truth is, I'm about to lose it
Don't think I can do this if I'm not with you
These are the lies that I tell myself at night
These are the lies that are keeping me alive
These are the lies
These are the lies that I tell myself at night
These are the lies that are keeping me alive
These are the lies
(La-la-la-la-lies. La-la-la-la-lies. La-la-la-la-lies lies.)
These are the lies
(La-la-la-la-lies. La-la-la-la-lies. La-la-la-la-lies lies.)
