                                      This is the second piece of my project, a generative visual work. I chose to make this patch more simpler than the first as I would like to use this patch to raise awareness for the horrific genocide in Palestine. This work represents the country, Palestine, whom is struggling, suffering and dying in current event or we can call it a 'war' betwen Israel today. I have created the Palestine's flag by coding it on P5.js (Atom software). The flag is being overshadowed by distorted words - portraying the sobbing of victims in Palestine who have lost their homes, families and dreams. I named this work "Where is the help", refering to them not getting help from International criminal law or other countries. This horrific genocide has been happening for years, the victims even started recording the the event live, to show people around the world of what is happening in Palestine. We as ordinary people, unfortunately could not make a change apart from raising awareness and donation, as we are relying on the goverments which they should have acted earlier. I have chosen dark blood red as the bankground html page as that represents the blood of the victims.
