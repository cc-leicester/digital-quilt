                                    <em>The Circular Vivid Polygons</em> is an artwork realised by the student <strong>Farah L.F. Abdul Razak</strong> in 2021, as part of the Year 1 Digital Arts Lab assessment.

                                    This is my first visual animation design. They are consisted of three dintintive polygon shapes, where in total there are six of them - moving clockwise and anti-clockwise - meaning the each same shape is moving against eachother so each could form it's own cut when intersects each other. Starting from the first shape (left), which is a triangle, in the middle is a 20 sides polygon and the right ones is a Heptagon. Deciding which color scheme to use is challenging, where they need to contrast each other as well as with the background, making them appear slight 3D, stand out and avoid the ordinary colors. As a result, purple, red and grayish blue were chosen. Where the brightest color, red, being in the middle as the spotlight while the purple and grayish blue to be surrounding the red. I also have chosen two color shades of the same color for each shape so they have this nice fading transition between dark and pastel, showcasing the warmth of the colors overall. I named this design "The Circular Vivid Polygons" because the strong "vivid" coloured "polygons" are moving "circularly".
